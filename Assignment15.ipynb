    "# Question 2\n",

    "# current_thread(): This function returns the Thread object corresponding to the caller's thread of control. \n",
    "# It is often used to obtain a reference to the currently executing thread. \n",
    "# With this reference, you can perform various operations on the thread, such as retrieving its name, setting thread-local data, or controlling its behavior. \n",
    "# This function is especially useful when working with thread-specific operations or when you need to identify the current thread in a multi-threaded environment.\n",

    "# Question 5\n",
    "# Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "# Increased performance: Multithreading allows for the concurrent execution of tasks, utilizing multiple CPU cores. This can lead to improved performance and faster execution of programs, especially when dealing with computationally intensive or I/O-bound operations.\n",
    "# Responsiveness: Multithreading enables programs to remain responsive and interactive even when performing time-consuming operations. By executing tasks concurrently, the program can continue responding to user input or handling other tasks in parallel.\n",
    "# Resource utilization: Multithreading allows for better utilization of system resources, such as CPU time and memory. It maximizes the usage of available cores, preventing them from being idle and ensuring efficient resource allocation.\n",
    "# Simplified design: In certain cases, multithreading can simplify the design of a program. It enables you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable threads, improving modularity and code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "# Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex to design, implement, and debug compared to single-threaded programs. Handling issues such as thread synchronization, race conditions, and deadlocks requires careful consideration and may introduce bugs that are difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "# Synchronization overhead: When multiple threads access shared resources or variables, proper synchronization mechanisms must be employed to maintain data consistency and avoid race conditions. The overhead of managing synchronization can impact performance and introduce additional complexity.\n",
    "# Increased debugging complexity: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging. Issues such as race conditions and deadlocks may be difficult to reproduce and diagnose, leading to longer debugging cycles.\n",
    "# Scalability limitations: Although multithreading can improve performance, it may not always scale linearly with the number of threads. As the number of threads increases, contention for resources and synchronization overhead may limit the overall performance gain."

    "# Question6\n",
    "# A deadlock occurs in a multithreaded or multitasking environment when two or more threads or processes are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources or complete specific operations.\n",
    "#It creates a situation where none of the threads can proceed, leading to a system deadlock.\n",
    "# Deadlocks typically occur when four conditions, known as the Coffman conditions, are met simultaneously:\n",
    "# Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held exclusively by a thread and cannot be simultaneously used by others.\n",
    "# Hold and Wait: A thread holding a resource requests another resource while still holding the current one\n",
    "# No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread; only the thread itself can release the resource.\n",
    "# Circular Wait: A circular chain of two or more threads exists, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.\n",
    "# To resolve deadlocks, various techniques can be used, such as resource scheduling algorithms, deadlock detection algorithms, and resource allocation strategies like resource hierarchy.\n",
    "# Race Condition:\n",
    "# A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes accessing shared resources or variables. \n",
    "# It arises when multiple threads try to access and manipulate shared data concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable and incorrect results.\n",
    "# Race conditions can occur due to the non-deterministic nature of thread scheduling, where the order of execution between threads is not guaranteed. \n",
    "# Race conditions can manifest in various ways, such as inconsistent or incorrect data, crashes, or other unexpected behavior.\n",
    "# To prevent race conditions, synchronization mechanisms must be employed to coordinate access to shared resources. Techniques such as locks, semaphores, mutexes, and atomic operations can ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time or enforce certain ordering constraints. Proper synchronization and thread-safe programming practices help mitigate race conditions and maintain data consistency."
