    "# In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It is a mechanism to handle errors and exceptional situations that may arise during the program's execution.\n",

    "# Exceptions are different from syntax errors in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax errors: Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors are detected by the interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, invalid variable names, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an error or exceptional condition is encountered. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are not detected during the parsing phase. Instead, they are raised at runtime when a specific condition occurs, such as division by zero, accessing an out-of-bounds index, or trying to open a non-existent file. Exceptions can be handled by using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully handle errors and continue its execution.\n",

    "# In summary, syntax errors are detected before the program runs and prevent its execution, while exceptions occur during the program's execution and can be handled and recovered from using exception handling mechanisms."
